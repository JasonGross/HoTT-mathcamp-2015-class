Coq: Prove ∀ x, x = base
~~~
you: intro
~~~
Coq: Now prove

x : S¹
--------------
x = base
~~~
You: "which x do I have?"
~~~
Coq: case 1:
-------- "you have base!"
base = base
~~~
You: by reflexivity!
~~~
Coq: Great!
~~~
Coq: "now vary that continuously along loop"
Prove:
------
transport (λ x. x = base) loop refl = refl


the data of an isomorphism A ≅ B is:
  f  : A → B
  f⁻¹ : B → A
  right_inv : ∀ x, f(f⁻¹(x)) = x
  left_inv  : ∀ x, f⁻¹ (f x) = x
