(** * Exploring equality via homotopy and proof assistants - Day 2 - Equality in Coq *)
(** Note: You may use either the lab computers, or your laptop.  Coq may not be installed on the Windows computers, you should use the Macs.  If the Macs do not have CoqIDE installed, you can go to https://coq.inria.fr/coq-85, download CoqIDE_8.5beta2.dmg, open it, and run CoqIDE directly, without installing it.

  This file contains the exercises for Day 2.  Some are explicitly marked as "Homework"; the rest can be done either in class or for homework.

  When doing exercises on your own, feel free to skip around; there are some interesting puzzles near the bottom (around [J_implies_UIP]).

  If you feel like you know exactly how a proof will go, but find it painful and tedious to write out the proof terms explicitly, come find me.  Coq has a lot of support for automation and taking care of things that are easy and verbose, so you don't have to. Proving should feel like a game.  If it doesn't, I can probably help you with that.

  N.B. There are many theorem provers out there, e.g., Agda, Idris, NuPRL, Otter, Twelf, Isabelle/HOL, Mizar, Metamath *)

(** Recall the informal proof from yesterday's homework, which "proved" that all proofs of [x = y] are themselves equal:

  The [J] rule says informally that if you have a proof [p] of [x = y], it suffices to assume that [y] _is_ [x] (to substitute [x] for [y] in what you are trying to prove), and to assume that [p] is [refl x] (to substitute [refl x] for [p] in what you are trying to prove).  Suppose we have a type [A], two inhabitants [x] and [y] of type [A], and two proofs [p] and [q] that [x = y].  By [J], it suffices to assume that [y] is [x], that [p] is [refl x], and hence it suffices to prove that [refl x = q], where [q] now has type [x = x].  To prove this, again by [J], it suffices to assume that [x] is [x] (it already is) and that [q] is [refl x], and hence it suffices to prove [refl x = refl x].  We can prove this by [refl (refl x)].  Thus for any proofs [p] and [q] that [x = y], we have [p = q].  Qed.

  Try to formalize this proof in Coq, and see what goes wrong.  It may help to use [refine] so that you can construct the proof sentence by sentence.  If you are having trouble figuring out how to instantiate [J] for a proof of equality [H : x = y], you can ask Coq to figure it out for you by running [destruct H.].  You can see what it did by typing [Show Proof.] afterwards. *)

    These are completely optional, and moderately challenging.  If you are interested, here are some problems that draw interesting connections between this material and category theory.

1. Can you find and prove a statement relating [sym_sym] to [sym_trans]?

2. Can you find and prove a statement relating [sym] to [trans_assoc] and [sym_trans] via [ap]?

3. The equality relation on a type forms a weak ω-groupoid (sometimes written as a weak ∞-groupoid).  This means that there is structure at every level.  The first few levels are given by [refl], [sym], and [trans] (level 1); [sym_sym], [sym_trans], [trans_assoc], [sym_refl], [trans_1p], [trans_p1], [trans_pV], and [trans_Vp] (level 2).  The theorem statements in general are known as the Stasheff polyhedra or Stasheff associahedra.  Can you discover more of these rules? *)
