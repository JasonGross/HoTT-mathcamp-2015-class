Type theory is an alternate way of doing mathematics.  There is regularity in the structure of equality, but in the standard presentation of type theory, equality is underspecified in some places (functions and types).  We can deduce a pretty way of filling in the underspecified places just by sinking ourselves deeply enough into type theory.  I hope to give you a sense of what this regularity is, and, through the homework, how to derive it.
